# Relation Extraction
This project do relation extraction work by Convolutional Neural Network <br>
The tool we used is Keras <br>

### This project includes: <br>
1. pre-processing python file of ACE data and SemEval data <br>
2. python file for relation extraction by CNN architecture <br>

### File intorduction: <br>
preceprocess_ace.py -- main function to extraction structure data from ace and save it as embedding form <br>
Xml_parse.py -- class for parse xml <br>
ACE_Process.py -- classes for ACE Data process, includes data structure, and parse function <br>
Relation.py -- class for turning relation mention into embedding <br>
Open_Tool.py -- class for other tool, includes load position matrix and word matrix and so on. <br>
