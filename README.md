# Relation Extraction
This project do relation extraction work by Convolutional Neural Network
The tool we used is Keras

This project includes:
1. pre-processing python file of ACE data and SemEval data
2. python file for relation extraction by CNN architecture

File intorduction:
preceprocess_ace.py -- main function to extraction structure data from ace and save it as embedding form
Xml_parse.py -- class for parse xml
ACE_Process.py -- classes for ACE Data process, includes data structure, and parse function
Relation.py -- class for turning relation mention into embedding
Open_Tool.py -- class for other tool, includes load position matrix and word matrix and so on.
