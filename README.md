# Relation Extraction
This project do relation extraction work by Convolutional Neural Network \n
The tool we used is Keras

This project includes: \n
1. pre-processing python file of ACE data and SemEval data \n
2. python file for relation extraction by CNN architecture \n
\n
File intorduction: \n
preceprocess_ace.py -- main function to extraction structure data from ace and save it as embedding form \n
Xml_parse.py -- class for parse xml \n
ACE_Process.py -- classes for ACE Data process, includes data structure, and parse function \n
Relation.py -- class for turning relation mention into embedding \n
Open_Tool.py -- class for other tool, includes load position matrix and word matrix and so on. \n
